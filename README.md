## Project Introduction

Personalized responses are essential for having an informative and human-like conversation. 
Because it is difficult to collect a large amount of dialogues involved with specific speakers, it is desirable that a dialogue generation model can learn to generate personalized responses simply from monologues of individuals. 

In this work, we proposed a novel personalized dialogue generation method which reduces the training data requirement to dialogues without speaker information and monologues of every target speaker.
